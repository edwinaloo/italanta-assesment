          We channel a significant amount of our resources into giving back through projects such as our coding school in Kakuma refugee camp, training teachers in pastoral Samburu, and our open-source coding initiatives providing entry-level opportunities to hundreds of junior engineers. These projects may not have an immediate financial return, but their impact can be tangibly measured in the long term.
